* I'm a first-year Ph.D student of the University of Pennsylvania.

* I'm very fortunate to have Professor [Rahul Mangharam](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rahulm/) be my supervisor.

* Previsouly, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I fortunately worked with Professor [Xiang Yin](https://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/).

* My current research interest mainly focus on autonomous racing.

* Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
